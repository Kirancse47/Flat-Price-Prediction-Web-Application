# Flat-Price-Prediction-Web-Application
# 1.PROBLEM STATEMENT
<p>
We propose to use machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to develop an algorithm that
can predict housing prices based on certain input features. The business application of this algorithm is
that classified websites can directly use this algorithm to predict prices of new properties that are going
to be listed by taking some input variables and predicting the correct and justified price.

# 2.OBJECTIVE
<ol>
  <li> Create an effective price prediction model.</li>
  <li> Validate the model’s prediction accuracy.</li>
  <li>Identify the important home price attributes which feed the model’s predictive power.</li>
</ol>

# 3.LINEAR REGRESSION
<p>
It is one of the most widely known modelling technique. Linear regression is usually among the first
few topics which people pick while learning predictive modelling. In this technique, the dependent
variable is continuous, independent variable(s) can be continuous or discrete, and nature of regression
line is linear.</br>
Linear Regression establishes a relationship between dependent variable (Y) and one or
more independent variables (X) using a best fit straight line (also known as regression line).
It is represented by an equation Y=a+b*X + e, where a is intercept, b is slope of the line and e is error
term. This equation can be used to predict the value of target variable based on given
predictor variable(s).
